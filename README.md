# LangGraph Implementations 🧠🔗

Welcome to the LangGraph Implementations repository! This collection showcases various implementations and experiments using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), a framework designed to build resilient language agents as graphs. LangGraph enables the creation of stateful, multi-actor applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), facilitating the development of complex conversational agents and long-running, multi-step LLM applications.

## Repository Contents 📂

- **LangGraph_Chatbot_with_Tools.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the integration of LangGraph to build a chatbot equipped with various tools, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

- **Langraph.ipynb**: An exploratory notebook delving into the foundational aspects of LangGraph, offering insights into its architecture and potential applications.

- **MultiAI_RAG_Chatbot_using_LangGraph_and_AstraDB.ipynb**: This notebook presents a sophisticated chatbot leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with flexible LLM integration, utilizing LangGraph and AstraDB to deliver precise and contextually relevant answers to user queries.
