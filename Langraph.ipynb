For example, it can identify a cat in a picture or predict the next word in a sentence.\\n* **GenAI** goes a step further by using those patterns to generate entirely new content. It can write stories, compose music, create art, and even code software.\\n\\n**Here are some key characteristics of GenAI:**\\n\\n* **Data-driven:** GenAI models are trained on massive datasets of text, code, images, audio, etc. This data allows them to learn the underlying patterns and structures of the content they generate.\\n* **Probabilistic:** GenAI doesn't simply reproduce existing data; it generates new content based on probabilities.
